# Optimization-of-Rapid-DNA-Forensic-Process-using-Monte-Carlo-Simulation

The coursework involved analyzing the rapid DNA forensic process used to match crime scene DNA samples in the UK. The task required optimizing multiple process stages to reduce overall processing time and improve efficiency.

Developed a model to simulate the DNA sample handling workflow, from crime scene reporting to DNA validation. The goal was to identify bottlenecks and recommend optimizations to improve the processing time of DNA samples.

Created a detailed simulation using Monte Carlo methods and probability distributions (Gamma, Uniform, Weibull, and PERT) to model waiting times at various stages, including CSI arrival, sample preparation, DNA sequencing, and validation. Ran "what-if" scenario analyses to test process improvements.

Identified key bottlenecks, such as CSI arrival and DNA sequencing, which accounted for over 50% of delays. By optimizing CSI sample collection time and adjusting DNA sequencer capacity, reduced overall sample processing time by 35% and increased the percentage of samples processed within 24 hours by 59%.
